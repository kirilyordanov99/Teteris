# Tetris
Learning how to make Tetris using javascript

To start the game you need web server, personally I use Web Server for Chrome.

## All JavaScript methods used for the game:

* addEventListener()
* querySelector()
* querySelectorAll()
* keyCode()
* Math.floor()
* Math.random()
* length
* forEach()
* splice()
* clearInterval()
* setInterval()
* some()
* innerHTML()
* every()
* add()
* remove()
* contains()
